                As it is the summer season, wildfires can appear a lot and occur many times all over the world. 
                These wildfires can be caused by many factors both human and natural, but either way, wildfires can destroy many habitats and societal structures.
                <br>
                <br>
                We often think of forests when wildfires occur, however, in the following graphic you will find that many other different types of landcovers burn more.
                In many of the years, you will find that savannas and shurblands/grasslands will often have more area burnt than forests. 
                Additionally, some years croplands will have a greater area burnt.
