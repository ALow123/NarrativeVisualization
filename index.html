                As it is the summer season, wildfires can appear a lot and occur many times all over the world. 
                These wildfires can be caused by many factors both human and natural, but either way, wildfires can destroy many habitats and societal structures.

                <br>
                When we read or listen to the news, we often think of forests when wildfires occur. 
                However unlike how they are portrayed in the media, many different landcovers (the surface component of land physically present and visible) often burn more than forests.
                In the following graphic, you will see that data selected from 2002 shows more land burnt for different landcovers than forets.
                Hover over the bars to see how much land was burnt!

                However, just as it may seem that other landcovers burn more than forests, there are years that forests can burn more than other landcovers.
                In the decade, most years croplands and forests often burn similar amounts. 
                This in light of forests making up around 31 percent of the world and croplands around 12 percent.
                The difference in coverage around the world is also what makes the graphic of year 2010 below special, since although croplands have more factors that make the land more susepticble to wildfires, forest wildfires had a greater negative effect in this year.

                Another example of how wildfires may not be portrayed the way it seems is in the graphic below showing the year 2020.
                Even though savannas cover approximately 20 percent of the world compared to the shrublands/grasslands covering half of the world, savannas in this year burned a lot more than its previous year and even more than shrublands/grasslands.
                This includes the fact that it is often shrublands and grasslands being the landcover burnt the most.

                As the grahpics above explore how wildfires may not be portrayed as it often seems, there are many different types of landcovers often effected worse than forests.
                Explore below how much land is burnt for each landcover from the years 2002 to 2022.
                Also explore how much land burnt changes year over year. 
                Lastly, hover over the bar to see how much land is burnt for that land cover.
